After I got my university diploma in information technology, I graduated and was valedictorian of a vocational degree with a special emphasis on Web conception and maintenance.

At work, I found out that many of the data going into our databases remained unexploited.

It was then that I decided to pursue my studies, and decided to enroll into a master’s degree with a special teaching in Business Intelligence and Big Data. It’s been a sacrifice but I was rewarded by being the valedictorian of the 2017’s year group.

You’ll find on this website many of the experiences I lead and would like to share with you.
