# WTF ?

![My Bepo Keyboard]({{ "/static/bepo.jpg" | prepend: site.base_url }})

I had the same reaction the very first time I heard those words. So what is Dvorak or the french version Bépo ?  
You probably already looked up those words in you favorite search engine before you reached the end of this sentence.  
Made simple, these are keyboard layouts that prevent injuries.

## Explain yourself !

QWERTY and AZERTY the traditional keyboard layouts are made to mitigate the mechanical problems that would occur, but they weren’t very adapted to the user comfort and now the data transfer happens electrically and not by hammering on a paper.

I bet you can type on your keyboard without looking but just take a few seconds to look at your hands when typing a text. Did you ever noticed all the kilometers your hands are travelling ?

Dvorak for English users or Bepo for French ones are layouts that were developed with these problems in mind. Based on the analysis of the frequency of the characters they are said to be much more practical and adapted to contemporary keyboard users.

I am a doubting Thomas, therefore I had to try the layout…

## How ?

Learning a new layout can be quite overwhelming. At the time I switched to this layout, I just switched to my current employer. I had to find a way to quickly learn this.

Fortunately, there is a free typing tutor that you can download [here]({{ 'http://klavaro.sourceforge.net/fr/' | absolute_url }}).

With this tool, you’ll learn step by step your new layout.

## Aren’t you confused by your previous layout ?

Muscle memory is amazing. As of now I’m using AZERTY at home and BEPO at work without any struggle. So yeah, it’s not an issue.

## What about the benefits ?

- I was skeptic at first before trying the new layout. I’m typing at minima 8 hours a day on a keyboard which is **a lot**. Sometimes I had pain in my hands after work, it’s something unconceivable because I also play the guitar and it hurt.
Now I’m relieved because the pain is gone.  
- You also have the most common letters (remember earlier, the part about frequency analysis ?) on the main row where your fingers rest 80% of the time.
- You can also type some special handy characters that aren’t directly available in your keyboard without some hand gymnastics (for instance : *— ≤ ≥ « » < > { } [ ] ° `* yup developers I’m looking at you ;))

## What about speed ?

Because a picture is worth a thousand words…

![Bepo speed]({{ "/static/bepo-speed.png" | prepend: site.base_url }})

My average WPM score would be more between 90 and 100.

## I’m still skeptic about your keyboard…

Just try it out, experience it yourself.
