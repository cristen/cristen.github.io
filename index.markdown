# Who am I ?

Hello and welcome to my website. Let’s talk about Python !

My name is Martins Jean-Marc, I’m a web developer using Python everyday as my main language. I also have some skills in data science and big data concepts.

I’m pleased to learn everyday about science, data and much more.

Information Technology is a wonderful ecosystem constantly evolving where you’ll learn something new everyday.
